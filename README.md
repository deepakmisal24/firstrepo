1) Fork
Fork: Fork is an operation been perform over the projects as real big projects contain chunks of pieces of code consisting of 1000 lines. Here if we try to do changes and if something goes wrong then it becomes very tedious for a programmer or community to correct it. So using this Fork operation we are creating a copy of the repository in which changes are supposed to be made and reflected without affecting the original project

2) Clone
Clone: When we create a new repository on GitHub or Any repository on Github, it exists as a remote location where our / any other repository is stored. Cloning a repository creates a local copy on our computer so that we can sync between both the local and remote locations of the repository.

3) Licenses

3.1) MIT
The MIT License, which is meant to be extremely straightforward and open. It permits users to do anything with a given project as long as they credit the developer and don’t hold him or her liable for the project’s use.

3.2) Apache
The Apache License, which is similar to the MIT License, but also explicitly grants patent rights to users.

3.3) GPL
The GPL License, which is older, more limiting, and less popular than the other two. It is a copyleft license that requires users to track their changes if they modify and then distribute a project. Different versions of this license also restrict the use of modified code in various classes of hardware.
